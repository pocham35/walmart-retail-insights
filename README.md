# walmart-retail-insights

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and SQL querying on Walmart retail sales data using Python and MySQL. Uncovered insights on customer behavior, product trends, and branch-wise performance with visualizations and queries.

The dataset (Walmart.csv) contains transaction-level data from three Walmart branches across different cities. Each record includes:

Invoice_ID, Branch, City

Customer_type, Gender

Product_line, Unit_price, Quantity

Payment method, Tax, Total, Date, Time

COGS, Gross_income, Rating

After importing into MySQL, the data is stored in a table named walmart_sales.

ðŸ›  SQL Skills Practiced:
âœ… Basic SQL Queries
SELECT specific columns from the table

WHERE clause to filter by city, gender, product line, etc.

ORDER BY to sort sales by revenue, quantity, or ratings

âœ… Aggregation & Grouping
GROUP BY used to analyze:

Sales per city

Average rating by product line

Revenue by gender

Aggregate functions used: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()

âœ… Joins
INNER JOIN used with a secondary table (branch_info) to add branch manager details to sales records

âœ… Date and Time Functions
MONTH(), DAY(), HOUR() to break sales into time periods

Used to identify peak sales hours or best-performing months

âœ… Aliasing & Limiting Results
AS for readable column aliases

LIMIT to restrict query output 

Example SQL Queries:

1. Total revenue by city
SELECT City, SUM(Total) AS Revenue
FROM walmart_sales
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;

2. Average rating per product line
SELECT Product_line, ROUND(AVG(Rating), 2) AS Avg_Rating
FROM walmart_sales
GROUP BY Product_line
ORDER BY Avg_Rating DESC;

3. Female customers in Yangon
SELECT * FROM walmart_sales
WHERE Gender = 'Female' AND City = 'Yangon';

4. Highest grossing invoices
SELECT Invoice_ID, Total
FROM walmart_sales
ORDER BY Total DESC
LIMIT 5;

5. Join with branch_info to fetch manager names
SELECT a.Invoice_ID, a.Total, b.Branch_Manager
FROM walmart_sales a
INNER JOIN branch_info b ON a.Branch = b.Branch;
